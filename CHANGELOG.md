# Change Log

All notable changes to Crumbs will be documented here.
## [0.1.4] - tbd

### Added
- MacOS "Getting Started" instructions. Revived my old Macbook. Works as expected üòÅ.
- Option to disable rowWrapping in the new FrameHex view.
- Selecting a field in the FrameTree now selects the bytes in the FrameHex View and vice versa.

### Changed
- Disabled the contextmenu on the FrameList. The context menu is an "Enterprise" feature of AGGrid and I can therefore not make use of it properly.
- Text of the recently introduced "Open Last Active Trace File in Wireshark" feature now better describes what it does.
- Refactored FrameHex view to make it more configurable.

## [0.1.3] - 2021-08-28
Some Quality updates and an initial Hex View üéâ. In the future this new Hex View should idealy be able to focus things in the Tree View and vice versa and live in more crumbled places too.

### Added
- New "Open Last Active Trace File in Wireshark" Command. For situations where Crumbs isn't enough.
